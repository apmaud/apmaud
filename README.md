## Hi, I'm Arjun! Welcome to my page ðŸ˜„

### My Journey So Far ðŸŒ±
I've always been interested in technology and computers, however I only started my programming journey recently! I recently graduated from New York University studying Violin Performance (strange I know) as my primary major. About mid 2022 I started to get into Data Analysis thanks to my chemistry classes and began programming with R and Python and fell love with the process of making code. I gained an appreciation for everything electronic around me that was built with programming.

I began to explore more about technology, learning full stack development on my own time, with JavaScript: React, and NodeJS, eventually moving onto building with frameworks such as Java Spring Boot and Python. It was eerily similar to practicing an instrument! The more time and effort I put into practicing programming, the better I got. I decided towards the end of my studies at NYU that I wanted to do this for a living. The constant practice and learning is something I was familiar and good at and most importantly being a part of a team to make real products would be undeniably fulfilling.

### Currently
I'm currently on the look-out for a role in full-stack development, ideally writing React with Java Spring Boot or NodeJS for the backend. I would especially love to work at a smaller startup where I can really see the results of my work and the effect it has on people. ðŸ‘¯
